# Port_Scanner
 port scanner to identify what ports are open in an ip address
This code is like a little program that can check if certain "ports" on a computer are open or closed. Let me explain it to you step by step:

First, the program imports some special tools that help it do certain things. It's like having a special kit of tools for a job.

Then, the program asks for some information. It wants to know the "target," which is the computer we want to check. It also wants this information to be given when we run the program from the command line.

After getting the target, the program prints a nice message to let us know it has started working.

Now comes the interesting part! The program tries to check if certain ports on the target computer are open. Think of a port as a little door on the computer that can be either open or closed. The program checks each port one by one to see if it's open or closed.

If a port is open, it means the program can connect to that port on the target computer. The program then tells us that the port is successful, like saying, "Hey, I can go through this door!"

After checking all the ports, the program finishes its work and says goodbye.

But wait! Sometimes, we might want to stop the program before it finishes checking all the ports. If we press a special key on the keyboard, it will stop and say goodbye.

The program also knows that sometimes the target computer's address (called a hostname) might not be correct or the program can't connect to the server for some reason. In those cases, it says something went wrong and stops.

So, this program is like a little detective that can check if doors (ports) on a computer are open or closed. It tells us which doors it can go through and if something doesn't work, it tells us that too.
